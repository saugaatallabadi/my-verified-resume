# My Verified Resume
### Thesis Project

A verified resume platform where employees can ask for a Letter of Recommendation from their previous companies for future references. The previous company can then upload the LOR's hash value and using asymmetric encryption, send it over an insecure network (internet). The employee receives it in their notification bar and add it to their resume after decrypting it using it's Private Key.
