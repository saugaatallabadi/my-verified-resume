# My Verified Resume
Thesis Project

A verified resume platform where employees can ask for a Letter of Recommendation from their previous companies, for future prospects. The previous companies can then upload the LOR's hash value and using asymmetric encryption, send it over an insecure network (example over Mail). The employee receives it in their notification bar and add it to their CV after decrypting it using it's Private Key.
